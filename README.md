This repository contains code for "Certified Robustness for Top-k Predictions against Adversarial Perturbations via Randomized Smoothing". 

Required python tool: numpy, scipy, statsmodels. 

# Code usage: 

topk.py is used to compute the certified radius for top-k predictions. 

compute_radius.py is used to read the frequency file (each line contains the frequency of each label for a sample and last column contains the label that we aim to certify, "cifar0.25.txt" is an example file) and save the results. 

You can directly run "python3 run.py" 

We also run the code and "result.txt" in the result file we obtained.
